As part of my fifth-term coursework at CE AAST, I successfully completed an advanced project focused on developing a robust university student portal system. Leveraging C# and the .NET framework, I designed and implemented a Windows application with an intuitive user interface. The system seamlessly interacts with a SQL database, strategically integrated locally within the solution.

Key Achievements:

*Comprehensive Course Management:

Developed a feature that allows advisors to create new courses and register students, streamlining the course management process.
Implemented functionality for postgraduate students to apply for postgraduate studies through a user-friendly interface.

*Efficient Student and Marks Management:

Designed a system that enables lecturers to easily access their students, view relevant information, and efficiently update marks.
Extended the same capabilities to Teaching Assistants (TAs), empowering them to manage student data and grades effectively.
Implemented a user-friendly interface for students to view their grades, providing them with easy access to their academic performance.

*User-Friendly Interface:

Created an intuitive and user-friendly interface for all user roles, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for advisors, lecturers, postgraduate students, TAs, and undergraduates.
